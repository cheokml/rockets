# Part I: Understanding Candles and the Markets

## What is a candlestick

Candles vs Wicks
>- Top/Bottom of Candle: Represents Open/Cose Prices
>- Top Bottom of Wick: Represents High/Low of candle timeframe

If Candle closes:
>- **above open**, candlestick = bullish
>- **below open**, candlestick = bearish

If Candle body is:
>- Long: Strong buying/selling pressure
>- Short: Little buying/selling activity

If wick is:
>- Long Upper Wick + Short Lower Wick: Buyers bought and bid higher price
        but sellers drove price back to open price
>- Short Upper Wick + Long Lower Wick: Sellers sold and forced lower prices
        but buyers came in and drove prices back to open


## Engulfing Bar Candlestick Pattern
 This is when the current candle fully **engulfs** the previous candle
> - Must consume at **least more** than one previous candle
    
**Bearish Engulfing Bar**
>    - First body is smaller than the second body 
>    - Bearish candle (Close is lower than open) 
>    - Signifies that sellers are in control
>       - Trend reversal
>       - This means that there's a high chance that price will start a downtrend
        
**Bullish Engulfing Bar**
>- Similar to Bearish Engulfing, first candle is small and second engulfs it
>- Signifies sellers are no longer in control of the market
>        Buyers are stepping in and taking control of the market
>- When bullish engulfing bar forms at the end of a downtrend, 
>        reversal is much more powerful 
>  - Represents capitulation bottom
>  - Capitulation means people are giving up and selling the stock
>  - Capitulation bottom means people are done selling and are ready to buy again

## Doji Candlestick Pattern
Doji Candlestick occurs when the candle is all wick
>    - This means that the market opened and closed at the same price
>    - Equality and indecision between buyers and sellers 
>        - No one is in control
>    - Normally means that market is about to reverse or prior trend losing strength
>        - ie Uptrend into a doji candlestick normally means it's about to reverse
>    - Could also mean period of resting after big moves
>    - Normally means time to take profits or time to enter

## Dragonfly Doji Pattern
This pattern forms when open + high and close are around the same price 
    and then there is a long lower wick
    
>    - This means that there is resistance from buyers and is their attempt to 
        push the market up
>    - You can use this pattern to identify support and resistance
>    - When this occurs during a downtrend, it is interpreted as a 
        bullish reversal signal

## Gravestone Doji Pattern
Gravestone Doji is the bearish version of the dragonfly doji
> - Open and close are around the same price but long upper wick
    
> - Buyers push price past open price
>  - But sellers overwhelm buyers and push it back to open price
> - Signifies that buyers are losing momentum and market is ready for reversal
> - For this pattern to be reliable, it must occur near resistance level

## Morning Star Pattern
Bullish Reversal Pattern 
>- Normally happens at the bottom of a downtrend
>- Holds significant trend reversal signal

Consist of three candlesticks:
>    1. First candlestick is bearish (red)
>        - Sellers are still in control
>    2. Second candle is smaller 
>       - Sellers are in control but can't push market much lower (can be bullish or bearish candle)
>    3. Third candle is bullish that gapped up on open and closed above the midpoint
        of the first candle

## Evening Star Pattern
Bearish Reversal Pattern 
> - Normally happens at the top of an uptrend

Consist of three candlesticks:
>1. First candlestick is bullish
>   - Buyers are still in control
>2. Second candle is a small candlestick meaning that not many more buyers 
>   - This candle normally means price consolidation and indecision
>3. Third candle is a large bearish candle


## Hammer Pattern
Open + High and Close are roughly the same price but long lower wick
> Similar to dragonfly Doji but the hammer occurs at the bottom of a downtrend
> 
> Reversal candlestick pattern
>- Hammer also closes slightly higher than the open whereas dragonfly
            doji closes at the same
> - Dragonfly Doji is normally a stronger reversal pattern
    
The long lower wick signifies strong buying power coming in despite
        sellers trying to push the market lower
> - Buying pressure > Selling pressure
> - Results in a trend reversal

## Shooting Star Pattern
Reverse Hammer Pattern:
> - Short candle, long upper wick 
> - Wick should be at least twice the length of candle
    
> - Bearish Reversal Signal
> - Buyers are trying to push market higher
>        Rejected by selling pressure
> - When this candle forms near resistance level, high probability
        of downtrend

## Harami Pattern
Considered a reversal, or a continuation pattern

Consists of two candlesticks:
>1. First Candle: Large candle (mother candle)
>2. Second Candle: Smaller candle (baby)
    - The second candle should close INSIDE the previous one
   
>- Bearish reversal signal when it occurs at the top of an uptrend
>- Bullish reversal signal when it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend
>- Tells us that the market is consolidating (indecision)
>- If it occurs during **up/downtrend**, it can be a continuation pattern
        which means it's an opportunity to join the trend
>- If it occurs at the **top of an uptrend** or **bottom of a downtrend**
        it means that it's a trend reversal signal

## Tweezers Pattern
There are two Tweezers Patterns:

1. Tweezers Top Formation
>    - Considered Bearish Reversal Pattern when seen at the top of
        an uptrend ( Green -> Red )
>       1. First candle is a thick green candle with little wick
>       2. Second candle is a thick red candle with little wick and is
        a little larger than first candle
>    - Occurs during uptrend when buyers push price higher but
        sellers surprise buyers by pushing market lower and closes
        down below the previous candle's open
    
2. Tweezers Bottom Formation
>    - Considered Bullish Reversal Pattern when seen at the bottom of
        a downtrend ( Red -> Green )
>       1. First candle is thick red candle with little wick
>       2. Second candle is a thick green candle with little wick and is the
        same size or a little bigger than first candle
>    - Occurs during downtrend when sellers push market lower but 
        next session closes above or at the previous candle's open. 
        This means that buyers are coming to reverse the market direction
>    - If this happens near a support level, a bearish reversal is likely
        about to happen

## Candlestick Pattern Exercise Notes
Red -> Green Scenarios
1. First Scenario
> Happening below support 
>    1. First Candle: Big Red Candle / Little Wick
>    2. Second Candle: Small Green Candle / Small wicks inside the first candle
>    - Harami -> Happening at a bottom of a downtrend so signals reversal

2. Second Scenario
>    Happening below support
>    1. First Candle: Big Red Candle
>    2. Second Candle: Big Green Candle
>   - Tweezers
>   - Both are around the same size so it means buyers are stepping in
        to stop sellers
>   - Signals downtrend reversal
>   - Going green

3. Third Scenario
>    Happening Below Support
>    1. First Candle: Big Red Candle with small top wick
>    2. Second Candle: Even Bigger Green Candle that opens lower and closes higher 
>        than Previous candle

5. Fifth Scenario
>    Happening Above support
 >   1. First Candle: Small red candle
>    2. Second Candle: Big Green Candle with some wick
>    - Second candle engulfs the first -> Support coming in -> Signals reversal
        -> Going green

## The Market Structure
There are three types of markets:
> 1. Trending Markets 
>   - Characterized by repeating pattern of higher highs and higher low in an 
        up-trending market and lower high and lower low in a down-trending market
>   - Utilize bigger timeframes such as the 4H, daily, or weekly time frame 
        to understand market structure
>   - Impulsive Move: This is when the makes an impulsive move along with trend
>   - Retracement Move: This is when the market pulls back and corrects itself

> 2. Ranging Market AKA sideways markets
>    - Neutral nature -> Just drifting to the right, horizontally
>    - Stops making consecutive higher peaks 
>    - Buyers and sellers knock price back and forth between
>       support and resistance levels
>    - Equilibrium between buyer and sellers | No one is in control
>    - Before trading ranging markets, you need to make sure that the market is worth trading
>       - Normally, choppy markets are not worth trading
>    - Trading Ranging Markets
>       1. Buying and selling opportunities occur at key support and resistance levels
>           - Buy at key support level and sell at key resistance level
>       2. Best entry is after the breakout 
>           - Range boundaries are often overshot so it can give an illusion
>       3. Waiting for a pullback after the breakout of the support, or the resistance level 

> 3. Consolidating

## Support and Resistance levels
These are proven areas where buyers and sellers find equilibrium
    that are considered major turning points in the market
    
> Forms when price reverses and changes direction 
>    - Price will often respect these levels 
>    - Contain price movement until price breaks through them
        
>If you understand how price action acts in a trending market
    you can predict with high accuracy when the next move will begin
    
>Bullish markets will tend to create a linear support and bearish markets 
    will form a linear resistance level

## How to draw trend lines
>Find at least 2 swing points and connect them together
>
>Levels _**MUST**_ be clear, don't force a trend line

## Timeframes and Top-Down Analysis
Primary Time Frames
- 1H
- 4H
- Daily

Top Down Analysis
- Begin with bigger time frames to get the big picture
- Switch to smaller time frames to decide whether to sell or buy

> If you want to trade 4H chart, look at weekly then daily
>   - If weekly and daily matches 4h chart then make your decision
> If you want to trade 1H, look at daily

The following are most important when reading charts:
- The most important support and resistance levels
    - Represent turning points in the market
    
- The Market Structure
    - Weekly Analysis will identify if market is trending up or down
    
- Previous Candle
    - The last candle on the weekly chart is important because it tells us what happens
    during a week + future market move
      
- The Market Condition
    - What the market is doing on the 4H time frame
    
- What are the most important key levels on the 4H or the daily time frame
    - This could be support & resistance, supply & demand areas, trendlines, etc.
    
- Price Action Signal
    - Candlestick patterns that will provide you with a signal to buy or short the market
