# What is a candlestick
"""
Candles vs Wicks
Top/Bottom of Candle: Represents Open/CLose Prices
Top Bottom of Wick: Represents High/Low of candle timeframe

If Candle is:
    - above open, candlestick = bullish
    - below open, candlestick = bearish

If Candle body is:
    - Long: Strong buying/selling pressure
    - Short: Little buying/selling activity

If wick is:
    - Long Upper Wick + Short Lower Wick: Buyers bought and bid higher price
        but sellers drove price back to open price
    - Short Upper Wick + Long Lower Wick: Sellers sold and forced lower prices
        but buyers came in and drove prices back to open
"""

# Engulfing Bar Candlestick Pattern
"""
This is when the current candle fully engulfs the previous candle
    - Must consume more than one previous candle
    
Bearish Engulfing Bar
    - First body is smaller than the second body 
    - Bearish candle (Close is lower than open) 
    - Signifies that sellers are in control -> Trend reversal
        This means that there's a high chance that price will start a downtrend
        
Bullish Engulfing Bar
    - Similar to Bearish Engulfing, first candle is small and second engulfs it
    - Signifies sellers are no longer in control of the market
        Buyers are stepping in and taking control of the market
    - When bullish engulfing bar forms at the end of a downtrend, 
        reversal is much more powerful -> Represents capitulation bottom
    - Capitulation means people are giving up and selling the stock
        so capitulation bottom means people are done selling and are ready to buy again
"""

# Doji Candlestick Pattern
"""
Doji Candlestick occurs when the candle is all wick
    - This means that the market opened and closed at the same price
    - Equality and indecision between buyers and sellers
        No one is in control
    - Normally means that market is about to reverse or prior trend losing strength
        ie Uptrend into a doji candlestick normally means it's about to reverse
    - Could also mean period of resting after big moves
    - Normally means time to take profits or time to enter
"""

# Dragonfly Doji Pattern
"""
This pattern forms when open + high and close are around the same price 
    and then there is a long lower wick
    
    - This means that there is resistance from buyers and is their attempt to 
        push the market up
    - You can use this pattern to identify support and resistance
    - When this occurs during a downtrend, it is interpreted as a 
        bullish reversal signal
"""

# Gravestone Doji Pattern
"""
Gravestone Doji is the bearish version of the dragonfly doji
    Open and close are around the same price but long upper tail
    
    - Buyers push price past open price but sellers overwhelm buyers and
        push it back to open price
    - Signifies that buyers are losing momentum and market is ready for reversal
    - For this pattern to be reliable, it must occur near resistance level
"""

# Morning Star Pattern
"""
Bullish Reversal Pattern - Normally happens at the bottom of a downtrend
    - Holds significant trend reversal signal

Consist of three candlesticks:
    - First candlestick is bearish: Sellers are still in control
    - Second candle is smaller -> Sellers are in control but can't push market
        much lower (can be bullish or bearish candle)
    - Third candle is bullish that gapped up on open and closed above the midpoint
        of the first candle
"""

# Evening Star Pattern
"""
Bearish Reversal Pattern - Normally happens at the top of an uptrend

Consist of three candlesticks:
    - First candlestick is bullish: Buyers are still in control
    - Second candle is a small candlestick meaning that not many more buyers 
        This candle normally means price consolidation and indecision
    - Third candle is a large bearish candle
    
"""

# Hammer Pattern
"""
Open + High and Close are roughly the same price but long lower wick
    Similar to dragonfly Doji but the hammer occurs at the bottom of a downtrend
        - Hammer also closes slightly higher than the open whereas dragonfly
            doji closes at the same
        - Dragonfly Doji is normally a stronger reversal pattern
    Reversal candlestick pattern
    
    The long lower wick signifies strong buying power coming in despite
        sellers trying to push the market lower
    - Buying pressure > Selling pressure
    - Results in a trend reversal
"""

# Shooting Star Pattern
"""
Reverse Hammer Pattern:
    Short candle, long upper wick (wick should be at least twice the length of candle)
    
    - Bearish Reversal Signal
    - Buyers are trying to push market higher
        Rejected by selling pressure
    - When this candle forms near resistance level, high probability
        of downtrend
"""

# Harami Pattern
"""
Considered a reversal and continuation pattern

Consists of two candlesticks
    - First Candle: Large candle (mother candle)
    - Second Candle: Smaller candle (baby)
    - The second candle should close INSIDE the previous one
    - Bearish reversal signal when it occurs at the top of an uptrend
    - Bullish reversal signal when it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend
    - Tells us that the market is consolidating (indecision)
    - If it occurs during up/downtrend, it can be a continuation pattern
        which means it's an opportunity to join the trend
    - If it occurs at the top of an uptrend or bottom of a downtrend
        it means that it's a trend reversal signal
"""

# Tweezers Pattern
"""
There are two Tweezers Patterns

Tweezers Top Formation
    - Considered Bearish Reversal Pattern when seen at the top of
        an uptrend ( Green -> Red )
    - First candle is a thick green candle with little wick
    - Second candle is a thick red candle with little wick and is
        a little larger than first candle
    - Occurs during uptrend when buyers push price higher but
        sellers surprise buyers by pushing market lower and closes
        down below the previous candle's open
    
Tweezers Bottom Formation
    - Considered Bullish Reversal Pattern when seen at the bottom of
        a downtrend ( Red -> Green )
    - First candle is thick red candle with little wick
    - Second candle is a thick green candle with little wick and is the
        same size or a little bigger than first candle
    - Occurs during downtrend when sellers push market lower but 
        next session closes above or at the previous candle's open. 
        This means that buyers are coming to reverse the market direction
    - If this happens near a support level, a bearish reversal is likely
        about to happen
